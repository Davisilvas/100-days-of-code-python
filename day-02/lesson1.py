# string -> characters
NAME = "Davi"
# -> See, a string is actually a "array" of characters unified, so we can iterate
# on it, letter by letter. That's how we are allowed to get only one character by it's
# index, just likelly our example bellow.

print(NAME[1])

# INTEGER
# in order to create an integer, just write the number with anything else.
AGE = 22
print(AGE + 2)

# we can use the underscores to help us see the numbers
print(2_001)

# FLOAT
pi = 3.14

# BOOLEAN
# True or False
